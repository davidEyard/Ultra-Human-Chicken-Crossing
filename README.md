# Ultra-Human-Chicken-Crossing

Welcome to my frogger like game. I used the starter code for [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) students and came up with this master piece. Have fun with the interactive game and let me know if there is any bugs within the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

More will be added to this game in the future.. stay tuned!
Cheers!
